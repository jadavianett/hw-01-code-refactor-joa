# Code Refactor Assignment 

## Description
Welcome to my Horiseon Code Refactor! This code refactor was necessary in order to 1) increase accesibility for those with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions and 2) clean up the code to make it as efficient as possible! 

In order to acheieve both of these goals, many changes were made to the original code. 

HTML -- In order to add semantic HTML elements, I swapped out many of the div elements for section, article, or aside tags. This change makes the code easier to read. I also added accesibile alt attributes for those with diabilities or socio-economic restrictions that may not be able to view the images. An appopriate title was added to round out the webpage and aid with SEO. 

CSS -- In order to consolidatde the CSS code, I combined many identical elements into single class groupings. This made the code much more concise and effective.
