# Code Refactor Assignment 

## Description
Welcome to my Hoiseon Code Refactor! This code refactor was necessary in order to 1) increase accesibility for those with disabilitys or socio-economic restrictions and 2) clean up the code to make it as efficient as possible! 

In order to acheieve both of these goals, many changes were made to the original code.
