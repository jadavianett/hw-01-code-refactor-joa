# Code Refactor Assignment 

## Description
Welcome to my Horiseon Code Refactor! This code refactor was necessary in order to 1) increase accessibility for those with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions and 2) clean up the code to make it as efficient as possible! 

In order to achieve both of these goals, many changes were made to the original code. 

HTML -- In order to add semantic HTML elements, I swapped out many of the div elements for section, article, or aside tags. This change makes the code easier to read. I also added accessible alt attributes for those with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions that may not be able to view the images. An appropriate title was added to round out the webpage and aid with SEO. 

CSS -- In order to consolidate the CSS code, I combined many identical elements into single class groupings. This made the code much more concise and effective. I also increased the font size to make the site easier to read.
